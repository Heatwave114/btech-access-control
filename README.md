# btech-access-control

A central access management system for doors in an organization. The system maintains a centralized database that contains a list of all the employees and their access rights. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is the system's core technology. Staff credentials are programmed into RFID cards that are issued to them. To gain access to an office, the staff brings his card into contact with the RFID sensors on the door.
